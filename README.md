**Open Manifold** is a free and open-source rhythm game with the goal of cloning the gameplay of the PS1 game *Rhythm 'N' Face* while offering several additional features, such as high resolutions, custom level support, and enhanced visual effects.

Currently (as of March 2023), it is not yet considered ready for general use, in the sense that it is missing several key features such as delay calibration and doesn't have much included content yet.

Open Manifold's engine is licensed under MIT, and the included content is licensed under CC-BY-NC 4.0 (see `LICENSE` for details).

## Getting Started

## Background

*Rhythm 'N' Face* was a rhythm game released exclusively in Japan for the [PlayStation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_%28console%29) in 2000. It was developed by Outside Directors, best known for the cult-classic game _[LSD: Dream Emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD:_Dream_Emulator)_ and for their geometry-based, psychidelic art style of which *Rhythm 'N' Face* is based around.
  
The object of the game was to create "faces" by moving and resizing a series of circles, squares, and triangles - corresponding to the respective buttons on a PlayStation controller - to the beat of a song. (The remaining button, X, is used for a "stall" function, referred to by this game as an "X-plode").

Unlike many other rhythm games, the exact timing and buttons the player must press aren't directly enforced by the chart; the player can use any sequence of movements on any beat of the song so long as the shape ends up in the right place.  Performance was scored not by timing accuracy, but rather shape placement and how frequently the player performed actions.
